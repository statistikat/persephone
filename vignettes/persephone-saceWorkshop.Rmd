# Introduction

The R-package [@R] **persephone** [@persephone] was developed and is still under development to enable easy processing of multiple time series during the production of seasonally adjusted estimates. It will be used as a successor of the R package **x12** [@x12] which is currently used at Statistics Austria.

**RJDemetra** [@RJDemetra], an R interface to JDemetra+ (https://github.com/jdemetra) is used to perform the seasonal adjustment. Additional,  analytic tools such as interactive plots are developed to support the SA expert. 
This tool makes it easy to construct personalized dashboards containing selected plots and diagnostics and to produce a Eurostat-Quality-Report.
The support of hierarchical time series is of importance in the workflow within an official statistics agency and in the future diagnostics for the comparison between direct and indirect seasonal adjustment will be included.

Note on the package name: Obviously, Persephone [@wiki:persephone] is an offspring of Demetra (Demeter) and Zeus and also a vegetation goddess. Therefore, it is a natural choice

# Installation

As the package is not yet on the comprehensive R archive network (CRAN http://cran.r-project.org), the main R package repository, so it can be installed from GitHub via the following command:

```{r installation, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("statistikat/persephone")
```

Optionally and preferably, it can be installed including vignettes (needs prettydoc[@prettydoc]).

```{r installation2, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("statistikat/persephone", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

After installation, the package can be loaded into the current R session.

```{r}
library(persephone)
```

# Constructing Persephone Objects

An object of class `persephone` can be constructed from only one or multiple time series. These multiple time series can be connected through a certain hierarchy.
Depending on whether seasonal adjustment should be performed with X-13-ARIMA-SEATS[@X13] or with TRAMO-SEATS [@Tramo],
'single' persephone objects are constructed with the functions  `per_x13()` or `per_tramo()`.
Multiple 'single' objects can then be combined with `per_hts()` to build a hierarchical persephone object.
Batch objects without a hierarchy can be represented as objects with a flat hierachy at the moment, but this will be improved in the future.

Persephone objects call the functions of **RJDemetra** in the background, so for a detailed documentation on the respective X-13 or TRAMO-SEATS methods refer to the R-help of **RJDemetra**.

## Persephone Single Objects

Univariate persephone objects are created with `per_x13()` or `per_tramo()` from univariate time series objects 
such as the `AirPassengers` data set.
A predefined JDemetra+ model specification has to be provided by the user, in this example we use `"RSA3"` 
(Log/level detection = automatic, Outliers detection = automatic, Calendar effects = NA, ARIMA = automatic).


```{r}
data(AirPassengers, package = "datasets")
obj_x13 <- per_x13(AirPassengers, "RSA3")
```

Now different methods can be called for the persephone object `obj_x13`.
Most prominently, the `run()` method performs call to JDemetra+ through RJDemetra to actual run seasonal adjustment method. The `output` field gives access to the original output object from 
**RJDemetra**. Before the first run, some methods for the object will not work and some fields will be empty since no results are available yet.

```{r}
obj_x13$run()
obj_x13$output$regarima
```

Several plot methods have been implemented and the focus was on using interactive tools. The default S3 generic `plot()` for example 
shows the time series with the `dygraphs` package [@dygraphs]. The result is a zoomable line representation of the series, 
see Figure \@ref(fig:plotmethod).

```{r , eval=FALSE}
plot(obj_x13)
```
```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.cap="\\label{fig:plotmethod} Output of the plot() method in the R-Studio viewer pane", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/plot.png")
```

## Persephone Hierarchical Objects

Hierarchical persephone objects are created with `per_hts()`. There are two options on how to provide the 'single' objects as input. Firstly, directly as arguments, as shown below, this kind of call is mainly applicable for a quite limited number of time series.
```{r}
obj_x13_1 <- per_x13(AirPassengers, "RSA3")
obj_x13_2 <- per_x13(AirPassengers, "RSA3")
obj_x13_hts <- per_hts(ts1 = obj_x13_1, ts2 = obj_x13_2)

```
Secondly, several 'single' objects can be concatenated into a list and provdied to the `list` argument of the `per_hts()` function.
We shall call these 'single' objects 'components' in this multivariate context.

In the more realistic examples below, we use time series of the volume index of production for total industry (except construction) 
of the EU-28 countries. They are monthly data published by Eurostat covering January 2000 through
June 2019. Some series contain missing values.
The data sets are downloaded from the Eurostat database [@STS] and provided with the R package to be used in examples and tests. They can be simply loaded with the `data` function.

```{r}
data(pi_caladj, pi_sa, pi_unadj, weights_pi_ea19, weights_pi_ea19)
```

We use the calendar and not seasonally adjusted data `pi_caladj` for illustrative purposes because it
only contains one missing value. `weights_pi_ea19` and `weights_pi_ea19` are the data sets containing 
the weights per country.

We remove the EU-28 and EA-19 (Euro Area) aggregates.

```{r}
pi_caladj_orig <- pi_caladj
pi_caladj <- pi_caladj[ , -c(1:2)]
```

We remove the last time point because of the missing value.

```{r}
pi_caladj <- window(pi_caladj, end = c(2019, 5))
```

### Aggregates without Weights

The next step is to construct a hierarchical persephone object that does not contain weights and computes aggregate series as the sum of the components.

To get started, we generate persephone objects with X13-ARIMA-SEATS as method for all countriesâ€™ time series. This is done by simply calling the R builtin function `lapply` to call the function `per_x13` on the list of time seriees objects  `pi_caladj`.

```{r}
ts_28 <- lapply(pi_caladj, per_x13)
```

The list argument can be used to create a hierarchical persephone object based on a list of 
persephone single objects. Here we aggregate the Euroarea (EA-19) countries and set the method to be used 
for the direct adjustment of the aggregate series to x13 as well.

```{r}
hts_EA19 <- per_hts(list = ts_28[weights_pi_ea19$country], method = "x13")
```

We now generate our final hierarchical persephone object `hts_EU28` which consists of the Euroarea countries as a hierarchical object and the 9 countries as single objects.

```{r}
non_EA19 <- weights_pi_eu28$country[which(!weights_pi_eu28$country %in% weights_pi_ea19$country)]
hts_EU28 <- per_hts(list = c(EA19=hts_EA19,ts_28[non_EA19]))
```

The structure of this object is represented in the `print` output.

```{r}
hts_EU28
```

We can initiate a first run with

```{r}
hts_EU28$run()
```

and have a look at the summary (sollte noch vor Finalisierung dieser Vignette fertig sein).

```{r}
# summary(hts_EU28)
```

The only plot function implemented for hierarchical persephone objects at the moment is a general comparison line chart called through the S3 generic `plot()`,
see Figure \@ref(fig:plotmethodhts).

```{r , eval=FALSE}
plot(hts_EU28)
```
```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.cap="\\label{fig:plotmethodhts} Output of the plot() method for a hierarchical persephone object in the R-Studio viewer pane", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/plot_hts.png")
```

We can however access the components of a hierarchical persephone object and use the methods developed for univariate analysis, e.g. we can plot the auto-correlations of the residuals for the Belgian time series, see Figure \@ref(fig:acfresbg), where the component `"BE"` can either be addressed by `hts_EU28$get_component("EA19/BE")` or 
by ` hts_EU28$components$EA19$components$BE`.

```{r , fig.cap="\\label{fig:acfresbg} Output of the plotResiduals() method for the Belgian time series", out.width = '100%'}
plotResiduals(hts_EU28$get_component("EA19/BE"), which = "acf", interactive = FALSE)
```

Also the results of lower level aggregate series are accessed via the components. 
The EA19 aggregate for example would be plotted by using the following command:

```{r , eval=FALSE}
plot(hts_EU28$get_component("EA19"))
```

### Weighted Aggregates

If the time series are indices, we are not really interested in the sum of the components but in the weighted sum.
We can use either time-invariant or time-variant weights.

#### Time-invariant weights

The weights parameter is set as a numeric vector with length equal to the number of components.
The hierarchical persephone object is constructed the same way as in the previous section but 
with weights, one for each component. Internally, an `mts` object is then created with constant
weights for all time points.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# right now bug in package, this object is overwritten after run of hts object
ts_28 <- lapply(pi_caladj, per_x13)
```

We include the weights from the data set `weights_pi_eu28` in the hierarchical persephone object

```{r}
w_EA19 <- weights_pi_eu28$weight[which(weights_pi_eu28$country %in% weights_pi_ea19$country)]
w_non_EA19 <- weights_pi_eu28$weight[which(!weights_pi_eu28$country %in% weights_pi_ea19$country)]

hts_EA19 <- per_hts(list = ts_28[weights_pi_ea19$country], method = "x13", weights = w_EA19)
hts_EU28 <- per_hts(list = c(list(EA19 = hts_EA19),ts_28[non_EA19]), weights = w_non_EA19)
```

and perform a run.

```{r}
hts_EU28$run()
```

We can have a look at the weights of an object by accessing the weights-slot.

```{r}
head(hts_EU28$weights)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# w_EA19 <- weights_pi_eu28$weight[which(weights_pi_eu28$country %in% weights_pi_ea19$country)]
# weights_pi_ea19$weight 
# # is equal to  
# w_EA19/sum(w_EA19)*100
```

We can also show that the EU-28 aggregate series generated by persephone matches the 
data published by Eurostat apart from certain rounding differences:

```{r}
# Eurostat EU28-Series
window(pi_caladj_orig[, "EU28"], start = c(2019,1))

# Persephone EU28-Series
window(hts_EU28$ts, start = c(2019,1))

# Maximum absolute difference
max(abs(pi_caladj_orig[, "EU28"] - hts_EU28$ts))
```
#### Time-variant weights

We do not have a real example for time-variant weights which is why we generate artificial ones
for our example.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# right now bug in package, this object is overwritten after run of hts object
ts_28 <- lapply(pi_caladj, per_x13)
```
```{r}
weights_pi_eu28_time <- do.call("c", apply(weights_pi_eu28,1, function(x){
   l <-  list(ts(rlnorm(nrow(pi_caladj))/5 + as.numeric(x[2]),start = start(pi_caladj),
                 end = end(pi_caladj),
                 frequency = frequency(pi_caladj)))
   names(l) <- x[1]
   return(l)
   }))
```

We can then create a hierarchical persephone object as in the previous section

```{r}
w_EA19 <- weights_pi_eu28_time[which(weights_pi_eu28$country %in% weights_pi_ea19$country)]
w_non_EA19 <- weights_pi_eu28_time[which(!weights_pi_eu28$country %in% weights_pi_ea19$country)]

hts_EA19 <- per_hts(list = ts_28[weights_pi_ea19$country], method = "x13", weights=w_EA19)
hts_EU28 <- per_hts(list = c(list(EA19 = hts_EA19),ts_28[non_EA19]), weights = w_non_EA19)
```

and perform a run.

```{r}
hts_EU28$run()
```

# Eurostat Report

The function `generate_qr_table()` renders a Eurostat quality report in the form of a `data.frame` which can then be exported by the user.

```{r}
eurostatQR <- generate_qr_table(hts_EU28)
head(eurostatQR)
```

The Eurostat QR corresponds to the JD+ plugin version 1, see \url{https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/content/61-insee-plugin-eurostat-job-vacancy-survey_en},
with the exception that no overall index of quality is included since it does not seem to be exported by
**RJDemetra** and is not trivial to reverse engineer.
