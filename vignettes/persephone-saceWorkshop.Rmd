## Abstract

The R-package persephone is developed to enable easy processing during the production of seasonally adjusted estimates. 
It builds on top of RJDemetra, an R interface to JDemetra+, and provides analytical tools such as interactive plots to support the SA expert. 
The package should make it easy to construct personalized dashboards containing selected plots and diagnostics and to produce a Eurostat-Quality-Report.
Furthermore it will support hierarchical time series and tackle the issue of direct vs indirect adjustment.


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
