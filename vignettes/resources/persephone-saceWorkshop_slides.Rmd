})
```

## Objective

Improve or replace R-package x12 currently used at Statistics Austria for seasonal adjustment.

Requirements:

* Easy processing of multiple time series during the production of seasonally adjusted estimates
in an offical statistics setting
* Support of hierarchical time series
* Weighted aggregate series
* R environment

Release of **RJDemetra**, an R interface to JDemetra+
&rarr; Availability of Eurostat-recommended JDemetra+ seasonal adjustment (SA) software for R users.

&rarr; Build wrapper around **RJDemetra** to fit our needs

## Overview

R-package **persephone** builds on top of **RJDemetra**.

* **persephone** provides SA-infrastructure for official statistics, i.e.
dealing with multiple (hierarchical) monthly/quarterly time series
* Functions of **RJDemetra** performing SA are called in the background.
* Available on https://github.com/statistikat/persephone (still under development)

## Constructing Persephone Objects

* Objects of class `persephone` can be constructed from only one or multiple time series.
* Multiple time series can be connected through a certain hierarchy.
* Batch objects without a hierarchy can be represented as objects with a flat hierarchy at the moment 
(this will be improved in the future).

1. _'Single'_ persephone objects are constructed with the functions `per_x13()` or `per_tramo()` 
depending on the choice of SA method (X-13-ARIMA-SEATS or TRAMO-SEATS).
2. Multiple 'single' objects can then be combined with `per_hts()` to build a _hierarchical_ persephone object.

## Examples

Examples in the following slides:

* Example 1: Persephone Single Object

* Example 2: Persephone Hierarchical Object

## Example 1: Persephone Single Object
Create a persephone 'single' object from a univariate time series object.

* A predefined JDemetra+ model specification has to be provided by the user, e.g. `"RSA3"` 
(Log/level detection = automatic, Outliers detection = automatic, Calendar effects = NA, ARIMA = automatic).
```{r, include=FALSE}
require(persephone)
```
```{r}
data(AirPassengers, package = "datasets")
obj_x13 <- per_x13(AirPassengers, "RSA3")
```
* Now different methods can be called for the persephone object `obj_x13`, most importantly the `run()` method
which performs the SA.
```{r}
obj_x13$run()
```

## Example 1: Persephone Single Object

* The `output` field gives access to the original output object from 
**RJDemetra**.
```{r, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
hook_output = knit_hooks$get('output')
knit_hooks$set(output = function(x, options) {
  # this hook is used only when the linewidth option is not NULL
  if (!is.null(n <- options$linewidth)) {
    x = knitr:::split_lines(x)
    # any lines wider than n should be wrapped
    if (any(nchar(x) > n)) x = strwrap(x, width = n)
    x = paste(x, collapse = '\n')
  }
  hook_output(x, options)
})
```
```{r, linewidth=65}
obj_x13$output$regarima
```

## Example 1: Persephone Single Object

* Several plot methods have been implemented with the focus on using interacive tools, e.g. the default S3 generic `plot()` 
shows a zoomable line representation of the series.
```{r , eval=FALSE}
plot(obj_x13)
```
```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.cap="\\label{fig:plotmethod} Output of the plot() method in the R-Studio viewer pane", out.width = '65%'}
knitr::include_graphics("plot.png")
```

## Example 1: Persephone Single Object

Other plot functions:

* `plotResiduals()`: Several interactive plots in connection with residuals for a persephone object
* `plotSeasIrrCal()`: Interactive plot of the seasonal component, irregular component and calendar effects for a persephone object
* `plotSiRatios()`: Interactive plot of SI-ratios (and, in case of x11, of seasonal factors) by period
* `plotSpectrum()`: Spectral Plots

## Example 2: Persephone Hierarchical Object

Create a hierarchical persephone object e.g. from a list of persephone 'single' objects.

* Data included in the package to be used for examples and tests: 
  * `pi_caladj, pi_sa, pi_unadj`.
They are multiple time series objects of the volume index of production for 
total industry (except construction) of the EU-28 countries from Jan 2000 to June 2019 
(monthly data published by Eurostat).
  * The corresponding weights `weights_pi_ea19, weights_pi_eu28`.
 
```{r, include = FALSE}
data(pi_caladj, pi_sa, pi_unadj, weights_pi_ea19, weights_pi_eu28)
```

* For this example we use the calendar adjusted data `pi_caladj` after performing some preadjustments.

```{r}
pi_caladj_orig <- pi_caladj
pi_caladj <- pi_caladj[, -c(1:2)]
pi_caladj <- window(pi_caladj, end = c(2019, 5))
ea19 <- weights_pi_ea19$country
eu28 <- weights_pi_eu28$country
```

## Example 2: Persephone Hierarchical Object

* We generate a list of persephone single objects with x13 as method for all countriesâ€™ time series.

```{r}
ts_28 <- lapply(pi_caladj, per_x13, template = "RSA3")
```

* We aggregate the Euro-area (EA-19) countries and set the method to be used 
for the direct adjustment of the aggregate series to x13 as well.

```{r}
hts_EA19 <- per_hts(list = ts_28[ea19], method = "x13")
```

## Example 2: Persephone Hierarchical Object

* We then generate our final hierarchical persephone object `hts_EU28` which consists of the 
Euro-area countries as a hierarchical object and the remaining 9 countries as single objects.

```{r}
non_ea19 <- eu28[which(!eu28 %in% ea19)]
non_ea19
hts_EU28 <- per_hts(list = c(EA19 = hts_EA19, ts_28[non_ea19]))
```

## Example 2: Persephone Hierarchical Object

* The structure of this object is represented in the `print` output. The "blank" component is the overall total.

```{r, echo_size=8, output_size=6}
hts_EU28
```

## Example 2: Persephone Hierarchical Object

The following methods can be called for the hierarchical persephone object:

* perform a run, i.e. perform SA.

```{r}
hts_EU28$run()
```

* generate a plot comparing original, directly and indirectly adjusted series.

* generate a Eurostat Quality Report.

More methods directed specifically at multiple (hierarchical) time series still need to be implemented/developed.

## Example 2: Persephone Hierarchical Object

*  General comparison line chart called through the S3 generic `plot()` 
(only plot function for hierarchical persephone objects at the moment)

```{r , eval=FALSE, echo_size=8}
plot(hts_EU28)
```
```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.cap="\\label{fig:plotmethodhts} Output of the plot() method for a hierarchical persephone object in the R-Studio viewer pane", out.width = '65%'}
knitr::include_graphics("plot_hts.png")
```

## Example 2: Persephone Hierarchical Object

* Generate Eurostat Quality Report with the function `generate_qr_table()`.

```{r, output_size=6}
head(generate_qr_table(hts_EU28), n = 4)
```


## Components of Persephone Hierarchical Object

Methods developed for univariate analysis can be used by accessing the components of 
a hierarchical persephone object.

Example: Generate Eurostat Quality Report with the function `generate_qr_table()`
for only one of the components, e.g. the persephone 'single' object for Belgium.

```{r}
generate_qr_table(hts_EU28$get_component("EA19/BE"))
```

## Weighted Aggregates

With **persephone** we can also generate weighted aggregates, e.g. for indices.

The `weights` argument of `per_hts()` is used for this purpose.

* Time-invariant weights -> vector (mts object with same weight for each time point created internally)
* Time-variant weights -> mts object (or named list of ts objects)

We can have a look at the weights of an object by accessing the `weights` field.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
hts_EU28$weights
```

A couple of time-invariant weights are included in the package as example data sets: `weights_pi_ea19, weights_pi_eu28`.

## Future Enhancements

* Diagnostics for hierarchical time series
* Benchmark method for direct adjustments
* Pure batch objects
* Summary method
* Dashboard for large numbers of time series
* Complete Eurostat-Report
